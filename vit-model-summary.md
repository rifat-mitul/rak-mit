## SUmmary on ViT

Vision Transformer (ViT) is a deep learning model architecture

- Initially designed for natural language processing (NLP), to computer vision tasks. 

- ViT represents an alternative approach to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

### Advantanges of ViT

1. The ability to handle images of arbitrary sizes
2. Capturing global context effectively, and being more interpretable due to its self-attention mechanism.
